A package of power spectral fun for heavy-ion physics!

There is a plethora of high energy physics articles out there which describes the matter formed in the
collisions of heavy-ions as akin to the primordial universe. Such matter is, after all, an extremely
hot and dense soup of quarks and gluons, just like the first moments after the Big Bang. 

On that note, our oldest window into the creation of the universe are photons that freely streamed 
after the first atoms were formed. These photons compose the comic microwave background (CMB), from 
which cosmologists have been able to glean not only information on the metric of the universe, but 
also on its dark matter and energy compositions.

When considering the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) created in accelerators and the CMB, their analyses comprise
on studying how left-over debris are distributed. In other words, what are the preferred directions of
emission of the resulting particles? How can these anisotropies help in the understanding of said
phenomena?

This project combines CMB methods with QGP debris, an exploration which resulted in the works: `"Angular
power spectrum of heavy ion collisions"`_, by M. Machado, P.H. Damgaard, J.J. Gaardhoeje and C. Bourjau,
and its follow-up `"Heavy ion anisotropies: a closer look at the angular power spectrum"`_, by M. Machado.
Both deal with `ALICE public data`_ on Pb-Pb collisions from 2010 extracted through the `mALICE framework`_.

Dive into the angular power spectrum analysis of heavy-ions by submmitting your favorite 3+1D-model data, 
experimental data itself, or simple MC-simulated particle distributions! Through the ``powspechi`` package,
which is coupled to `HEALPix`_, one can map hadrons onto the surface of a sphere, calculate their angular
power spectra and perform the necessary corrections. Just install the package and try out the tutorial!

.. note:: The resulting angular power spectra will always be given as a *dictionary*. Single and averaged spectra 
 follow the formats below:

 .. code-block:: python

        single_powspec = {'full': numpy.array(), 'mdz': numpy.array()}
        avg_powspec = {'full': [numpy.mean(), numpy.std()], 'mdz': [numpy.mean(), numpy.std()]}

 where `'full'` and `'mdz'` correspond to :math:`C_{\ell}` and :math:`C^{m\neq0}_{\ell}`, respectively. The
 latter quantities are defined in ``powspec_calc.maps2cld``.
